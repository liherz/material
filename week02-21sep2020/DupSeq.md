# DupSeq (Duplex Sequencing)

## Overview

DupSeq is a next-generation sequencing technique, which enables detection of very rare true mutations. 
Both strands of DNA are tagged with complementary tags, sequenced and then with the help of their tags compared to each other.
If both strands contain a particular mutation, then it is a true variant.

## Technology - Application - statistics:
Dup-Seq - (low frequency) Variant calling (SNVs) - Hypothesis testing
